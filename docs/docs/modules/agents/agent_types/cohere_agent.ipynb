      "In 2017, a team of researchers at Google Brain, which included Aidan Gomez, published a paper called \"Attention is All You Need,\" which introduced the transformer machine learning architecture, setting state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. In 2019, Gomez and Nick Frosst, another researcher at Google Brain, founded Cohere along with Ivan Zhang, with whom Gomez had done research at FOR.ai. All of the co-founders attended University of Toronto.Gomez has been serving as the company's CEO since its founding. On December 13, 2022, it was announced that Cohere had appointed former YouTube CFO Martin Kon as their new president and chief operating officer.In November 2021, Google Cloud announced that they would help power Cohere's platform using their robust infrastructure, and Cloud's TPUs would be used by Cohere for the development and deployment of their products.In June 2022, Cohere launched Cohere For AI, a nonprofit research lab and community dedicated to contributing open-source, fundamental machine learning research. It is led by Sara Hooker, a former research scientist at Google Brain.In December 2022, Cohere released a multilingual model for understanding text that would work with over 100 languages, to help users search for documents by meaning instead of with keywords. This type of process was not previously widely available in languages other than English.On June 13, 2023, Oracle announced a partnership with Cohere to provide generative AI services to help organizations automate end-to-end business processes. As a result, Cohere's technology is integrated into Oracle's business applications, including Oracle Fusion Cloud, Oracle NetSuite, and Oracle industry-specific applications. On July 18, 2023, McKinsey announced a collaboration with Cohere, to help organizations integrate generative AI into their operations. In 2023, Cohere collaborated with software company LivePerson to offer customized large language models for businesses.On September 12, 2023, it was announced that Cohere had become one of 15 tech companies to agree to voluntary White House measures on testing, reporting, and research on the risks of AI. On September 27, 2023, it was announced that Cohere had also signed Canada's voluntary code of conduct for AI, to promote the responsible development and management of advanced generative AI systems.\n",

The paper proposed a novel deep learning architecture called the transformer, that enables machine learning models to analyze large amounts of data for patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions.  It has been commonly adopted for training large language models and in the development of generative AI. In 2017, Gomez founded FOR.ai, a program to help researchers learn machine learning techniques in a collaborative format, which later became Cohere For AI.As a PhD student, Gomez worked as a machine learning researcher at Google Brain. At that time, he co-authored the paper \"One Model to Learn Them All\" about multi-task learning by a single neural network.In 2019, Gomez left Google Brain to launch Cohere, an enterprise-focused company that helps businesses implement AI into chatbots, search engines, and other products. He is CEO of the company, which has been valued at over $2 billion.Gomez was named to the 2023 Time 100/AI list of the most influential people in the field of artificial intelligence.
